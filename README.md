# traffic-light-project
this project talks about how to make traffic light this project simulates the traffic light.
this project aims to organize roads traffic and save the pepole from danger.
this project divided to code and simulation.
first, the code is written with c++ language, the code is divided into first definition of ports this used to 
define the pins in arduino 
and second definition is "void setup" in which it is written command in the output 
and third definition "void loop" in which it is written command in the project example :-
specifies which led will work before the other and the time it will take for the led light 
second :- simulation is work in the program (proteus) and the first step definition is the library arduino in proteus because know definition the arduino in the proteus put the arduino uno in prog and put the three led 
one :-red 
two:-yellow
three:-green 
and three resistances measure ohm 
the connecting is made pin ten of possitive led green and pin nine of  possitive led yellow and pin eight of positive led red  and put about every led resistant and connect the every negative about ground and get the arduino (.hex) file in proteus and run the program 
find the led red work for a period of time which is five second after that led yellow work of a period of time which is two seconds after that led green work of a period of time which is five seconds
